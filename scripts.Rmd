# Script-based workflows {#scripts}

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = fs::dir_create(tempfile()))
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE, comment = "#>")
```

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
library(drake)
library(tidyverse)
invisible(drake_example("script-based-workflows", overwrite = TRUE))
files <- list.files(
  "script-based-workflows/R/",
  pattern = "*.R",
  full.names = TRUE
)
tmp <- file.copy(files, ".", recursive = TRUE)
tmp <- file.copy("script-based-workflows/raw_data.xlsx", ".")
tmp <- file.copy("script-based-workflows/report.Rmd", ".")
dir.create("data")
```

## Function-oriented workflows

`drake` works best when you write functions for data analysis. Functions break down complicated ideas into manageable pieces.

```{r}
# R/functions.R
get_data <- function(file){
  readxl::read_excel(file)
}

munge_data <- function(raw_data){
  raw_data %>%
    mutate(Ozone = replace_na(Ozone, mean(Ozone, na.rm = TRUE)))
}

fit_model <- function(munged_data){
  lm(Ozone ~ Wind + Temp, munged_data)
}
```

When we express computational steps as functions like `get_data()`, `munge_data()`, and `fit_model()`, we create special shorthand to make the rest of our code easier to read and understand.

```{r}
# R/plan.R
plan <- drake_plan(
  raw_data = get_data(file_in("raw_data.xlsx")),
  munged_data = munge_data(raw_data),
  model = fit_model(munged_data)
)
```

This function-oriented approach is elegant, powerful, testable, scalable, and maintainable. However, it can be challenging to convert pre-existing traditional script-based analyses to function-oriented `drake`-powered workflows. This chapter describes a stopgap to retrofit `drake` to existing projects. Custom functions are still better in the long run, but the following workaround is quick and painless, and it does not require you to change your original scripts.

## Traditional and legacy workflows

It is common to express data analysis tasks as numbered scripts.

```
01_data.R
02_munge.R
03_histogram.R
04_regression.R
05_report.R
```

The numeric prefixes indicate the order in which these scripts need to run.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# run_everything.R
source("01_data.R")
source("02_munge.R")
source("03_histogram.R")
source("04_regression.R")
source("05_report.R") # Calls rmarkdown::render() on report.Rmd.
```

## Overcoming Technical Debt

`code_to_function()` creates `drake_plan()`-ready functions from scripts like these.

```{r}
# R/functions.R
load_data <- code_to_function("01_data.R")
munge_data <- code_to_function("02_munge.R")
make_histogram <- code_to_function("03_histogram.R")
do_regression <- code_to_function("04_regression.R")
generate_report <- code_to_function("05_report.R")
```

Each function contains all the code from its corresponding script, along with a special final line to make sure we never return the same value twice.

```{r}
print(load_data)
```

## Dependencies

`drake` pays close attention to dependencies. In `drake`, a target's dependencies are the things it needs in order to build. Dependencies can include functions, files, and other targets upstream. Any time a dependency changes, the target is no longer valid. The `make()` function automatically detects when dependencies change, and it rebuilds the targets that need to rebuild.

To leverage drake's dependency-watching capabilities, we create a `drake` plan. This plan should include all the steps of the analysis, from loading the data to generating a report.

To write the plan, we plug in the functions we created from `code_to_function()`.

```{r}
simple_plan <- drake_plan(
  data        = load_data(),
  munged_data = munge_data(),
  hist        = make_histogram(),
  fit         = do_regression(),
  report      = generate_report()
)
```

It's a start, but right now, `drake` has no idea which targets to run first and which need to wait for dependencies! In the following graph, there are no edges (arrows) connecting the targets!

```{r}
vis_drake_graph(simple_plan)
```


## Building the connections

Just as our original scripts had to run in a certain order, so do our targets now.
We pass targets as function arguments to express this execution order.

For example, when we write `munged_data = munge_data(data)`, we are signaling to
`drake` that the `munged_data` target depends on the function `munge_data()` and 
the target `data`.

```{r}
script_based_plan <- drake_plan(
  data        = load_data(),
  munged_data = munge_data(data),
  hist        = make_histogram(munged_data),
  fit         = do_regression(munged_data),
  report      = generate_report(hist, fit)
)
```

```{r}
vis_drake_graph(script_based_plan)
```

## Run the workflow

We can now run the workflow with the `make()` function. The first call to `make()` runs all the data analysis tasks we got from the scripts.

```{r}
make(script_based_plan)
```

## Keeping the results up to date

Any time we change a script, we need to run `code_to_function()` again to keep our function up to date. `drake` notices when this function changes, and `make()` reruns the updated function and the all downstream functions that rely on the output.

For example, let's fine tune our histogram. We open `03_histogram.R`, change the `binwidth` argument, and call `code_to_function("03_histogram.R")` all over again.

```{r echo = FALSE}
writeLines(
  c(
    "munged_data <- readRDS(\"data/munged_data.RDS\")",
    "gg <- ggplot(munged_data) +",
    "  geom_histogram(aes(x = Ozone)) +",
    "  theme_gray(20)",
    "ggsave(",
    "  filename = \"data/ozone.PNG\",",
    "  plot = gg,",
    "  width = 6,",
    "  height = 6",
    ")",
    "saveRDS(gg, \"data/ozone.RDS\")"
  ),
  "03_histogram.R"
)
```

```{r}
# We need to rerun code_to_function() to tell drake that the script changed.
make_histogram <- code_to_function("03_histogram.R")
```

Targets `hist` and `report` depend on the code we modified, so `drake` marks 
those targets as outdated.

```{r message = FALSE}
outdated(script_based_plan)

vis_drake_graph(script_based_plan, targets_only = TRUE)
```

When you call `make()`, `drake` runs `make_histogram()` because the underlying 
script changed, and it runs `generate_report()` because the report depends on 
`hist`.

```{r}
make(script_based_plan)
```

All the targets are now up to date!

```{r}
vis_drake_graph(script_based_plan, targets_only = TRUE)
```

## Final thoughts

Countless data science workflows consist of numbered imperative scripts, and `code_to_function()` lets `drake` accommodate script-based projects too big and cumbersome to refactor.
 
However, for new projects, we strongly recommend that you write functions. Functions help organize your thoughts, and they improve portability, readability, and compatibility with `drake`. For a deeper discussion of functions and their
role in `drake`, consider watching the [webinar recording of the 2019-09-23 rOpenSci Community Call](https://ropensci.org/commcalls/2019-09-24).

Even old projects are sometimes pliable enough to refactor into functions, especially with the new [`Rclean`](https://github.com/provtools/rclean) package.
